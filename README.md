# Remittance risk flagging app

*Experimental* showcase of llama2 pre-trained open source models. 

This app uses llama2 to show a ChatGPT competitive app to score remittance descriptions. Ie a human explains what they are transferring funds for and it comes up with a High,Low or Med score and reason for flagging for a further screening perhaps by another human (or to apply other rules). 

Uses <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">llama2</a> model (7b also works ok) so it can run on modest hardware. 

NOTE: Obviously not ready for any production use, more a showcase of how useful llama2 can be out of the box.
